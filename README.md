# MVC structure in NodeJS

## I work on sample project Tasks and apply MVC Pattern on it.

- Tasks like Todo-list.
- you can add tasks.
- Update already made tasks.
- delete tasks.
- there is user and user can make many tasks
- make migration files to be migrated in
- database folder inside migrations
- make Views and HTML templates in Views Folder
- make all my routes and Endpoints in Routes Folder
- make midllewares and layers on routes in middlewares inside Routes folder
